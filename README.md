First HTML Project
Aim of the project is the create simple recipe website to learn how to use HTML properly. This is the assignment from The Odin Project. Website won't look pretty as I only know how to use HTML for now. I will use anchor tags, heading and other basic HTML stuff to practice it. Website will include photos and links to the recipes.
